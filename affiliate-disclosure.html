            <h3>Our Affiliate Relationships</h3>
            <p>This page contains affiliate links. This means if you click on a link and purchase a product, we may receive a small commission at no additional cost to you.</p>
            <p>The Indoor Eden Co. is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. We also participate in affiliate programs with other retailers and brands that align with our values and the needs of our readers.</p>
            
            <h3>How Affiliate Links Work</h3>
            <p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website, a small piece of tracking code is attached to your browser. If you then make a purchase on the destination website within a certain timeframe (typically 24 hours to 30 days, depending on the program), we earn a commission on that sale.</p>
            <p>These commissions help support the operation of The Indoor Eden Co. and allow us to continue creating free, helpful content about indoor plants and their care.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Product Recommendation Philosophy</h3>
            <p>We take our product recommendations seriously, and our affiliate relationships do not influence which products we choose to feature. We only recommend products we genuinely believe in and that we have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researched extensively</li>
                <li>Used personally (when possible)</li>
                <li>Received positive feedback about from multiple reliable sources</li>
                <li>Verified meet our quality standards</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The commissions we earn never influence our product reviews or recommendations. We prioritize honesty and transparency in all our content.</p>
            
            <h3>Product Reviews</h3>
            <p>When we review products, we assess them based on their performance, quality, and valueâ€”not on commission rates. We aim to provide balanced reviews that highlight both the strengths and limitations of products.</p>
            <p>If we ever receive free products for review, we will clearly disclose this in the content. However, receiving free products does not guarantee positive reviews.</p>
            
            <h3>How We Use Affiliate Income</h3>
            <p>The affiliate commissions we earn go toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Website hosting and maintenance costs</li>
                <li>Creating new, high-quality content</li>
                <li>Photography and visual resources</li>
                <li>Research materials and plant care supplies</li>
                <li>Compensating our team for their work</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Identifying Affiliate Links</h3>
            <p>While we may not label every individual affiliate link on our site, we include disclosure statements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At the beginning of posts containing affiliate links</li>
                <li>Near product recommendation sections</li>
                <li>In our website footer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a general rule, you can assume that most links to products on our site are affiliate links.</p>
            
            <h3>Non-Affiliate Content</h3>
            <p>Much of our content does not include affiliate links. Our plant care guides, troubleshooting articles, and educational content often contain no monetized links at all. We create this content purely to help our readers succeed with their indoor plants.</p>
            
            <h3>Contact Us</h3>
